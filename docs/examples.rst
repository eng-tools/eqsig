Calculation of response spectrum
--------------------------------

Array based input example:

The majority of eqsig's functions have been implemented using the ``eqsig.Signal`` and ``eqsig.AccSignal``,
however, many have also been implemented using numpy arrays. While it is recommended to
use the ``AccSignal`` object as an input, you can also use the array-based version of the function.
